## Project Goal
This project is to train neural network models for image classification.

## Introduction
In this project, the task is to train models that correctly predict where the vehicle in a given image is a truck or a car / automobile.

The project includes:

* Neural networks fine-tuning
* Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)
* Feature maps

## Dataset
A set of given vehicle images.
